		<h1>Test timer resolution</h1>
		<p>This test generates timestamps in a dedicated web worker and compiles a few statistics. A test run generates 25 million
			(25165824) timestamps and also checks if the clock is monotonic. This can only test the resolution of timers, not their
			accuracy.</p>

			<li>Diff is the difference between two consecutive distinct timestamps
				<br>diff = timestamp_n+1 - timestamp_n</li>
			<li>Here, "Jitter" is absolute difference between two consecutive diffs
				<br>jitter = abs((timestamp_n+2 - timestamp_n+1) - (timestamp_n+1 - timestamp_n))</li>

		<p>Aside from the standard statistics like the mean and standard deviation of the samples, this test also calculates a few
			more robust statistics. The sampling process can be easily disturbed by a lot of external factors, many of which can't
			be controlled from within the test environment. Things like the load on the system and fore-/background tab/window and
			how the browser reacts to those changes can all influence the test result. The more robust stats ignores outliers and
			can be a better indicator of the behavior of the clock</p>
