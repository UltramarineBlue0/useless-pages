		<h1>Test timer resolution</h1>
		<p>This test generates timestamps in a dedicated web worker and compiles a few statistics
			<br> It can only test the resolution of timers, not their accuracy.
			<br> A test run generates 25 million (25165824) timestamps
			<br> Test checks if the clock is monotonic</p>

		<p>% of total: the ratio of the number of distinct timestamps to all generated timestamps
			<br> Diff is the difference between two consecutive distinct timestamps
			<br> diff = timestamp_n+1 - timestamp_n
			<br> Here, "Jitter" is absolute difference between two consecutive diffs
			<br> jitter = abs((timestamp_n+2 - timestamp_n+1) - (timestamp_n+1 - timestamp_n))</p>
		<p>Aside from the standard statistics like the mean and standard deviation of the samples,
			<br>this test also calculates a few more robust statistics.
			<br>The sampling process can be easily disturbed by a lot of external factors,
			<br>many of which can't be controlled from within the test environment.
			<br>Things like the load on the system and fore-/background tab/window and how
			<br>the browser reacts to those changes can all influence the test result.
			<br>The more robust stats ignores outliers and can be a better indicator of the behavior of the clock</p>
